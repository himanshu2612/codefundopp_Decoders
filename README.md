We will be working on developing an Mobile Application Platform called "RELIEF". 
RELIEF will be a multitask crossplatform application that can prove very helpful before, during and after disasters.

#Features:
1. A Live News Feed system, where users from different location around the world can share weather related information, disasters happening around the world. Publsihing a news will ask exact location of the event. This will help other people know the weather conditions prior to any mishappenings. There will also be alert system that can alert User based on data collected from news feed system. During sign-up, user need to add his/her location.
2. Online funding for relief for disasters, where anyone can donate from around the world to the main distasters happening around the world.
3. During Disasters, food shortage and medicinal requirements is very big problem. RELIEF will have a platform called "Nearby Collection Site" where Govt./Communities can manage food and medicine collection drives across the cities and people can give packaged food, clothes and medicines. People can live chat managing the collection drive.
